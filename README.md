# Flask Demo

A simple project designed to learn about the Flask framework, it will also act as a refresher on Docker basics for me.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.4 or newer
- Docker Desktop 4.31.1 or newer

## Usage

Clone the repository: https://github.com/amccullough02/flask_demo

To launch the application, run: `docker-compose up`

To stop the application, run `docker-compose stop` or use `ctrl-c` in the active terminal window.
